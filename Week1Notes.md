# Week 1 Lecture Notes

**Questions**

* Knowledge Question: What does framing tell us about the power of word choices media makers use to describe facts? (100 words or less) **59 minutes**
  * **Words are sybolic and they are powerful but they're also mental shortcuts for understanding**
  ---
  
   By chosing the words to characterize certain stances on beliefs, producers of mass media can control what the public percieves those ideas as on an extreame sufrace level. As mentioned in the lecture "Words are sybolic and they are powerful but they're also mental shortcuts for understanding." Using a word such as Pro-Life can incite a more reasonable emotion  than Anti-Abortaion. Although the ideas are identitcal, its framing will be take precedence.

* Knowledge Question: In what ways can we say media is a mirror on society? (100 words or less)
  
    ---

    Media often determines what our current society cares most about. Due to the constant use of media in our society, continuously covered topics by mass media sources will greatly influence the focus of our society. This will directly result in media mirroring society concerns and focuses. One might say the media itself does not continuously reflect society, but in constant time, media can cause society to become a reflection of its ideals. This also reffering to mass media in a generalization.

* Knowledge Question: What kind of press freedom model does the U.S. have, and why do free democracies care so much about questions of free expression and press ownership? (100 words or less)

    ---

    The US press freedom model is the Libritarian Model. Democracies care about questions of free expression and press ownership because press freedom is an essential part of preserving government transperancy. As mentioned in the lecture, the US press is considered the unofficial fourth branch of the government. This is becuase it serves to hold the other three branches accountable. Without and form of governmental pressure or ownership, democratic media can look to serve the people who hold the power within a democratic system.

  * Libertarian Model
* Knowledge Question: What are the two levels of agenda-setting, and what do they describe? (100 words or less)
  
    ---
    The first level of agenda-setting is based on what consumers of media think about. This can take form of the continuous coverage of issues to draw focus from the consumer. The second form of agenda-setting is based on the way consumers think of things. Media outlets can characterize events and control how consumers preceive certain events. This is known as the second level since when coupled with the first, the consumer is not only focused on an event but their opinion is also fabricated.


    ---

  * Agenda-setting works on individual messages but also in aggregate
  * First level:what to think about
    * We take cues from the news about what to think about
  * Second Level: How we think about things
    * The news characterizes things and we come to see facts based on how things are described over time

* Knowledge Question: How might we describe the trend in media ownership over the past 50 years? (100 words or less)

    ---
    The trend of media ownership over the past 50 years is the trend of constant aquisition. In almost every facit of commercial media, there is constant competition. To gain an edge, media companies have constantly acquired smaller media companies to grow in overall size. Many of the largest media companies today grew in size from constant aquisition. It is then through the synergistic marketing of these conglomerates that media companies can continue to grow.

* Reflection Question: Using ideas from the lectures, why is understanding the flow of ad revenue critical to understanding why legacy media businesses thrived and why they are now struggling? (150 words or less)

    ---

    By understanding the flow of ad revenue, the upward and downward trends of media are easily explained. When print media was at its peak in popularity, so was the ad revenue for a media company. It was through these times that print media constantly expaneded following suit with the growing ad revenue trend. Once non-paper media forms became more popular to younger generations, ad revenue for legacy paper media started to fall. This fall in ad revenue created a cycle of cutbacks that led to a decrease in quality which also led to a reapeated dicrease in ad revenue. This flow of ad revenue is a direct result of the legacy print media's successes and eventual struggles. Although print media is not enitirly obseliete, legacy media companies now have to take modern approaches to maintain a sustainable flow of revenue.

* Reflection Question: Using ideas from the lectures, what are forces outside your control that mean your media choices actually represent a limit on how you see the world? (150 words or less)

    ---

    Forces that can limit a consumer's perception on the world can exist in many different forms. In most cases, these forces often revolve around the creation of media that can most effectivly grab a consumer's attention. These forces are specifically agenda-based media looking to captivate a consumer's attention. Once a consumer is captivated within an agenda, it is common that the consumer will focus on media supporting that preferred agenda. It is in this form of tunnel vision that access to differing opinions can be limited. This is most common in political TV, but forces such as this can also manifest from any media outlet. These forces in question can be interpreted as the forces in which media companies generate income from things like advertising or subscriptions.

* Reflection Question: Using ideas from the lectures, what are the most important factors for individuals to consider when thinking about the media's power over their lives? (150 words or less)

    ---

    Factors that should be considered when talking about the power of media revolve around the true intention of a media company. Most successful media companies are very effective at drawing a consumer's attention. What an organization does with this attention is what should be most factored when talking about the media's power. For example, most popular news programs are very successful at making users deeply care about what they constantly cover. Alternatively, Disney is very successful at creating high-budget continuous successful sequals. For individuals to consider a media's power over their lives the way in which their attention is directed is the most important factor.
