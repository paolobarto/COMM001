* oversetimeate their chances of experienceing violence
* believe that their neighborhoods are unsafe
* sate that fear of crime is a very serious personal problem
* assume that the crime rate is rising regardless of the actual crime rate
  
Gerber argued that violent televison
* pushes adies other ways of portrayind conflict
* deprives viewers of other choices
* facilitates the victim mentatility
* discourages production of alternative programming


# The critical/cultural Approach

**Crititcal Theory**
* There are serious problems that people suffer that come from the exploitations and division of labor
* People are treated as "things" to be used rather than individuals who have value
* You cant make sense out of ideas and events if you take them out of historical context
* Society is coming to be dominated by cultural indistry that take cultural ideas, turns them into commodoties, and sells them in a way to make the maximum amount of money. This sperates ideas from the people who produce them
* You cannot seperate facts from the values attached to them and the circumstaces from which these fact emerged

**critical/cultural approach** - considers how meanins is created within society, who controls the media systems, and the roles the media play in our loves. Instead of looking at how messages affet people, it looks at how people use and construct messages
