# Types of communication
Types of communication:
1. Intrapersonal - One to self
2. Interpersonal - One to one
3. Public speaking - One to group
4. Mass Communication - One to many

## Intrapersonal
"This is how we think and how we assign meaning to all the messages and events that surround our lives"

"Our own thoughts on what we want to communicate directly or indirectly with others are parts of important decisions that we may not pay enough attention to"

## Interpersonal 
"The intenetional or accidental transmission of informaiton thorugh verbal or nonverbnal message systems to another human being"

## Group Communication
"- when a network of people are communicating with each other"

"A key characteristic here is that our roles as senders and receivers are constantly changing."

Example: Concert, performer->audience (performance), audience->performer(applause)

## Mass communication
"Society wide communication process in whcih an individual or instition uses technology to send messages to a large mixed audience"

"The speaker does not know who is recieving the communications"ew

Examples: News, politican 


# Understanding our media world
**Media Literacy** - refers to the people's understanding of what the media are, how they operate, what messages they are delivering, what role they play in society and how audience members respond to media messages.

People with high levels of media literacy have the ability to control what they see through media.

People with low levels of media literacy often fall victim to the problems protrayed in society. I.E. people watching the news thinking the world is more dangerous than it really is.

4 parts of media literacy

2. Emotional
3. Aesthetic
4. Moral

# Models of Mass Communication
Mass communication is a process whereas the mass media are simply the technological tools used to transmit the messages of mass communcation. 

The four different models for mass communication
1. Transmission model
2. Ritual Model
3. Publicity model
4. Reception Model

## Transmission Model
This model is considered older and dated. 

**Sender** - the source of the messeges that go out through mass communcation

**Message** - the content being transmitted by the sender and reacted to by the reciever

**Encoding** - 
1. The sender's idea must be turned into a message
2. message is prepared for transmission

**Channel** - the medium used to transmit the message

**Reciever** - audience for the mass communication that are receiveing and decoding the message

**Decoding** - the process of translating a signal from a mass medium into a form the reciever can understand

**Noise** - can interfere with the delivery of the message (i.e. semantic noise when reciever does not understand message)


# Mass Communication Models
Model | Origin Of Sender | Orientation of reciever
---------|----------|---------
 Transmission Model | Transfer of Meaning | Cognitive processing
 Ritual Model | Performance | Shared Experience
 Publicity Model | Competetive display | Attention-giving spectatorship
 Reception Model | Preferntial encoding | DIfferential decoding/construction or meaning

# Ritual Model
Considers How and why someone might consume media 

Example: going or watching the superbowl but not actually being a fan, Wathching the voice but not actually caring about singing or advertising

# Publicity Model
The meare fact that a topic is covered by the media makes it more important than it really is

# Reception Model
Focus on how media memerbs derive and create meaning out of media content.
